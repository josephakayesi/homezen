## Acknowledgments

Hats off to the [Victor Bruce](https://twitter.com/Victorbruce3) who had earlier provided feedback of my Figma design. One of my long time partners. I drew inspiration from a portfolio website I had built in a Webflow University Course. The title of the course is 21-day design portfolio course and you can find it [here](https://university.webflow.com/course-lesson/portfolio-course-introduction)
